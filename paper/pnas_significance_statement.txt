Indecisive behaviour is highly prevalent in many aspects of daily life. Despite its ubiquity,
there has been very little focus and a lack of explanation for why indecisions occur. Here
we find under high time pressure scenarios that indecisions arise by misrepresenting ad-
ditional time delays and temporal uncertainties associated when attempting to switch
from reacting to guessing. Our novel paradigm presents a new way to elucidate and
study indecisions.
