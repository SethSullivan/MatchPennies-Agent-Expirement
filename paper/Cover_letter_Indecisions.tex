%         PAPER SIZE, PAGE NUMBER, AND DOCUMENT LAYOUT NOTES:
%
% The next \usepackage line changes the layout for CV style section
% headings as marginal notes. It also sets up the paper size as either
% letter or A4. By default, letter was used. If A4 paper is desired,
% comment out the letterpaper lines and uncomment the a4paper lines.
%
% As you can see, the margin widths and section title widths can be
% easily adjusted.
%
% ALSO: Notice that the includefoot option can be commented OUT in order
% to put the PAGE NUMBER *IN* the bottom margin. This will make the
% effective text area larger.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE THE ``of LASTPAGE'' next to each page number,
% see the note about the +LP and -LP lines below. Comment out the +LP
% and uncomment the -LP.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE PAGE NUMBERS, be sure that the includefoot line
% is uncommented and ALSO uncomment the \pagestyle{empty} a few lines

Dear Editor,
\justify
\vspace{1.0mm}
We are writing to request that you consider our paper, \textcolor{myudblue}{\textbf{Indecision under time pressure arises from suboptimal switching behaviour}}, for publication in \emph{Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance}.
\vspace{3.0mm}
\\
Indecisions can be catastrophic, preventing a life-saving response or leading to a loss of large sums of money.  Despite their importance and high prevalence, indecisions have been surprisingly ignored in the literature. The main culprit is that the field of decision-making leans heavily on the classic two-alternative forced choice task---where a human or animal \emph{must} select one of two potential options---which simply does not permit a non-response past some deadline (i.e., indecision). Of the few papers that have considered a deadline, indecisions are usually only mentioned in passing and, more often, simply removed from analyses and discarded from model fitting. \textbf{The field has consequently overlooked a common and hallmark feature of human and animal behaviour---indecisions.}
\vspace{3mm}
\\
Here we designed a novel paradigm to study high pressure scenarios that lead to indecisions. We found a median indecision rate of approximately 20\%, \textbf{with some participants even displaying over 50\% indecisions despite having plenty of time to make a guess.} Our computational modelling suggested that these indecisions arose by not accounting for the time delay and uncertainty associated when switching from reacting to guessing. In a second experiment, we show for the first time there is an inherent and functionally relevant time delay when switching from reacting to guessing, a phenomenon previously unreported in the literature. \textbf{Our paper novelly provides a mechanism to explain how indecisions arise.}
\vspace{3mm}
\\
We fully expect that our work will broadly draw interest from fields as diverse as Decision-Making, Economics, and Sports Science, which are all interested in the role of decision-making on behaviour.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
\vspace{3mm}
\\
Sincerely, 
\vspace{3mm}
